# Agent guide

One painting; one rig and its takes.

## Start here

1. Read `project.json`. Human acts go through Review; ingest exports. Never type human answers/signatures.
2. Run `rig-create next` to derive the next moves and whose they are.
3. Resume per {{RESUME_LINK}}.

{{REOPEN_EXCEPTION}}

Stale pins: `rig-create packages upgrade --by <operator>`.

Declare the painting: `init --painting <file> --origin <words>` or
`input add <path> --painting --origin <words>`. `project.json.painting` binds
one input, survives restart and checks sibling artwork; optional on older records.

## The order, and what you may not do

`interview` → `plan-approved` → `parts` → `parts-review` (the parts, by eye) →
`rigging-interview` → `rigging` → `rig-review` (the rig, still frame) → `post-interview` → `post` →
`direction-review` → `accepted`. Any stage can become `paused`.

- Only human `signoffs[]` advance `stage` or pass plan checkpoints.
  Draft, propose, build and measure in any stage; production rigging waits for `rigging-interview` ({{STAGES_LINK}}).
- Never infer answers from images. Offer a pick per ask: one reasoned
  recommendation, Other and auto. Retain the shown set; never preselect.
- Record "auto" as delegated with your decision on the item; never leave it blank.
- {{INTERVIEW_CHECK}}

## The user's four steps

1. **Parts and meshes**. Ask framing/source; review a labelled draft's parts and mesh/chest structure. `parts-review` records its Review API response.
   The latest receipt must approve the draft for `structure-snapshot --draft <id> --out <f>`
   and `signoff parts-review --draft <id> --structure-file <f>`; record component triage with `diff-classes --diff-report <p> --by agent` ({{DRAFTS_LINK}}).
2. **Rigging interview**. Ask fresh bones, deformation, physics and motion
   against approved parts/structure; use interview-options/answer/decision.
3. **Rig and animation**. Keep rig feedback.
   Ingest: `review <version> --from-review <actId>`.
4. **Direction**. `job open --rig <post>` asks the verdict only.
   Ingest `review <post> --from-review <actId>`, then `job open --plan` for
   record-page sign-off (source-linked Review).

Ask: `job open --reviewer <id> --role owner --question <id>` or `--plan`;
ingest `--from-review <actId>`, then advance.
Keep the host up across bound writes; after a stop, `job open` with reviewer/role,
then `job reconcile` before writing.

Use `advance <stage>` and `step-status <id>` (`rig-create --help`).
`advance parts-review` needs `--parts-check <report> --parts <assembled dir>`,
refusing {{PARTS_CHECK_LINK}}.
In `parts`, record an `intake-report` preflight and offer its choice, both advisory:
{{INTAKE_LINK}}.

Keep drafts in `derived/drafts/<id>/`, outside versions/handoff.
Preserve history/dates; adopt choices explicitly.

## Before you ask, plan or show

- **Prior words.** In adopted projects, show them verbatim as a tailored option
  with source/date; require a pick. Legacy derivation: {{DERIVED_LINK}}.
- **Bars before sign-off.** Each reading names its command, checked against
  installed `--help`. A reading with no command is a STOP before sign-off.
  Loop bars: INTERVIEW.md, "Bars have reading commands".

## Where things go

Each folder's lifetime and git status: {{LIFETIME_LINK}}.

## What to read, and why

{{READ_FIRST}}

Use installed docs at `package.json`'s pins, not memory.
Run refusal `(see … guide …)` commands first.
